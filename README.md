# Java Client Library for OneDrive & OneDrive for Business REST APIs

The OneDrive & OneDrive for Business Java Client is a Java client library for REST API. It is designed to work with both OneDrive & OneDrive for Business and to have light dependencies.

![Build Status](https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=Client/onedrive-java-client-master)

## Building

`mvn clean install`

## Getting Started

### Maven

To import the client as maven dependency, declare it as follow for latest release :

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.nuxeo.onedrive</groupId>
  <artifactId>onedrive-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you want to use the on development version, declare :

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.nuxeo.onedrive</groupId>
  <artifactId>onedrive-java-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Artifact is available in nuxeo repositories :
- `http://maven.nuxeo.org/nexus/content/groups/public`
- `http://maven.nuxeo.org/nexus/content/groups/public-snapshot`

### OneDrive

To use the client with OneDrive you first need to create a `OneDriveBasicApi` to use it after with items of client :
 
```java
OneDriveAPI api = new OneDriveBasicAPI("YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN");
```
 
### OneDrive for Business

To use the client with OneDrive for Business you need to create a `OneDriveBusinessAPI` to use it after with items of client :

```java
OneDriveAPI api = new OneDriveBusinessAPI("YOUR_RESOURCE_URL", "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN");
```
 
`YOUR_RESOURCE_URL` corresponds to your sharepoint resource url provided by microsoft, for example : `https://nuxeofr-my.sharepoint.com`.

### First calls

Now you have your `api` object you can request the APIs, for example to get the root folder run :

```java
OneDriveFolder root = OneDriveFolder.getRoot(api);
```

Or just get a folder or file item :

```java
OneDriveFolder folder = new OneDriveFolder(api, "FOLDER_ID");
OneDriveFile file = new OneDriveFile(api, "FILE_ID");
```

Then retrieve the metadata :

```java
OneDriveFolder.Metadata folderMetadata = folder.getMetadata();
OneDriveFile.Metadata fileMetadata = item.getMetadata();
```

## Features

- Iterate over folder children, to get all temporary download urls for example :
```java
public List<String> getChildrenDownloadUrls(OneDriveFolder folder) {
    List<String> urls = new ArrayList<>();
    for (OneDriveItem.Metadata metadata : folder) {
        if (metadata.isFile()) {
            urls.add(metadata.asFile().getDownloadUrl());
        } else if (metadata.isFolder()) {
            urls.addAll(getChildrenDownloadUrls(metadata.asFolder().getResource()));
        }
    }
    return urls;
}
```

- Download content of file :
```java
InputStream stream = file.download();
```

- Get ThumbnailSet :
```java
Iterable<OneDriveThumbnailSet.Metadata> folderThumbnail = folder.getThumbnailSets();
OneDriveThumbnailSet.Metadata fileThumbnail = file.getThumbnailSet();
String smallUrl = fileThumbnail.getSmall().getUrl(); // Get the small thumbnail url
InputStream smallStream = fileThumbnail.getSmall().getResource().download(); // Download the content of small thumbnail
```
You can also request thumbnail this way :
```java
OneDriveThumbnail thumbnail = new OneDriveThumbnail(api, "FILE_ID", OneDriveThumbnailSize.SMALL);
String smallUrl = thumbnail.getMetadata().getUrl();
InputStream smallStream = thumbnail.download();
```
Or while getting metadata with `expand` parameter :
```java
OneDriveFile.Metadata metadata = file.getMetadata(OneDriveExpand.THUMBNAILS);
...
OneDriveThumbnailSet.Metadata fileThumbnail = metadata.getThumbnailSet();
```
- Get email of current user :
```String email = OneDriveEmailAccount.getCurrentUserEmailAccount(api);```

## Limitations

Currently the OneDrive Java Client doesn't provide OAuth support to obtain or refresh an access token. You might obtain one before using the client.
